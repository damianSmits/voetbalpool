A combination of all the major topics learned during Software Engineer traineeship at Sogyo. 

<i> Technologies used: JavaScript, Node.JS, Vue.JS, AVA, CSS and HTML and MySQL.</i>

The goal was to create online application used to predict results of football matches, and eventually entire tournaments. The technical challenge was to make this application single-page, something I did not have much experience with at the time. The framework I used for this is Vue.js. Business logic was Test Driven Developed, using AVA, a test runner for NodeJS, which in turn was used as a webserver.
